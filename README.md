# Student Performance & Behavior :rocket:


## Dataset :bar_chart:  

Hello! I created this dashboard with [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudelhemaly/students-grading-dataset/data) collected on Kaggle, which maintains a large repository of public datasets on various topics, such as health, finance, sports, images, text, among others. Users can explore, download and even contribute with new datasets. Excellent repository, I recommend it.


## Colors :large_blue_circle: :red_circle:
The color palette used was this [one](https://coolors.co/palette/edafb8-f7e1d7-dedbd2-b0c4b1-4a5759) do Coolors que é uma plataforma online usada para gerar e explorar paletas de cores de forma rápida e intuitiva. Ele é muito popular entre designers, ilustradores e desenvolvedores que precisam criar combinações de cores harmoniosas para projetos gráficos, websites e branding.

## Mockup :pencil2:
The [mockup](https://www.figma.com/proto/CTNwMA68KeNIY0mkd3CvDe/Students_Grading?node-id=1-2&t=dYpnNZw5UDVPvrP7-0&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2)
 was generated in Figma based on this model [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7308789501693194240/) by [Nayara Hellen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nayara-hellen-data-analyst/) . Figma is an online tool used to create designs, prototypes and interfaces collaboratively. It is very popular among designers and developers because it allows several people to work on the same project at the same time, without having to install anything on the computer.

## Animate :ferris_wheel:
 [Animista](https://animista.net/) is an online tool that allows you to create and preview custom CSS animations. It provides a wide variety of pre-defined animations, such as transitions, entrance and exit effects, text animations, and more. It was used to generate the effects for the cover.
